Scrum is a popular framework for agile software development that is used by many companies for structuring software development and for improving teamwork among developers. The general idea of Scrum us learning from past mistakes and improving upon them. This ensures that the team always strives to produce a better product and improve their workflow for each iteration. It's important that the process is transparent and that everyone agrees on what is being done and what needs to be done.

There are many confusing terms used in Scrum, and I will go through them here to try and explain what they mean in simple terms. The process might look intimidating but is really quite simple and easy to grasp. Similar processes are used in other agile development methodologies but under different names.

Before learning about Sprints, it's important to know how the Product Backlog works.

A Product Backlog is a list of all the artifacts that are needed to finish the product and is also the place where changes to product planning are being made. Every requirement, extension, etc. are written down in the backlog along with their estimated time, priority, and order. Each Sprint consists of a series of Product Backlog items, usually starting with those with the highest priority. Changes are often made to the product backlog, as new information is acquired after every sprint.

In Scrum, an iteration is called a 'Sprint'. With that out of the way, we can learn what a Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, Sprint Goal, Sprint Backlog, and a Sprint Planning Meeting is. Let's start with the Sprint Planning Meeting as that is the first thing that is being done before a Sprint is started.

**Sprint Planning Meeting** is held just before a Sprint and is attended by everyone in the Scrum team. It is supposed to last a maximum of 8 hours if the Sprint lasts a month (which is the average normal length of a Sprint) and consists of 2 parts:

1.  What will be delivered to the client in this Sprint?
2.  How are we going to achieve this delivery?

That's really all there is to a Sprint Planning Meeting and after the meeting is done, the team should be able to explain how they are going to deliver the product to the client and in what ways they are going to work together.

**Sprint Backlog** is a collection of artifacts from the product backlog that was chosen for the Sprint and also serves as a guideline for what ultimately needs to be delivered at end of the Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is constantly being changed during the Sprint as the team finishes pieces of the product and adds more works that need to be done. It gives a real-time image of the current Sprint and how much work needs to be done.

**Sprint Review** is held after the Sprint is done and is an informal meeting where the team reviews what was delivered (and what was not) in this Sprint and slowly start preparing for what needs to be done in the next Sprint. It should last about 4 hours in a one month Sprint. The review works as a good baseline for what needs to be discussed in the next Sprint Planning Meeting.

**Sprint Retrospective** is a way for the team to 'inspect' themselves and their workflow. It is held after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning Meeting. It should last 3 hours in a one month Sprint. While the review was focused on the product, the retrospective focuses on the developers themselves and their teamwork. Discuss what problems (if any) occurred during the Sprint and how these can be solved in the next one.

**Sprint Goal** is the sum of all the requirements that were established in the Sprint Planning Review. It's important that the development team always has the Sprint Goal in mind while working. It serves as a road-map for the project ensures that no time is wasted.

Now that you know how iterations are handled in Scrum, let's focus on the people that are going to do the work. A Scrum team consists of the developers themselves, a Scrum Master and a Product Owner. The Development team is supposed to be self-organizing, meaning they can handle the work themselves without much outside input.

A **Product Owner** is responsible for maximizing the value of both the product and the development team. He administers the Product Backlog and makes the necessary changes and tries to ensure that the developers manage to finish everything in there, by making sure everyone understands each artifact and how they rank in importance. The Product Owner is always one single person. If the developers want changes made to the Product backlog, he is the one they need to contact.

A **Scrum Master** is responsible for ensuring that everyone follows the Scrum practices and understands them as well as promoting teamwork among the developers. His main role is communication between teams and making sure the various meeting is done the right way. He is the person on the team most knowledgeable about Scrum and must promote its use in the organization.

The last thing you need to know about Scrum is the specialized meeting that takes place during development.

**Daily Scrum** is a daily meeting of about 15 minutes that is held by the development team, where they can create a plan for what needs to be done in the next 24 hours. They quickly discuss what was done since last time, what needs to be done today, and what challenges can be in the way. Each person in the team outlines these 3 points in a quick and efficient manner.

Here you can see how all the elements work together and in what order. The process is repeated again for each Sprint.

If you want more information on Scrum, here is a great video that easily explains the various concepts of Scrum in under 10 minutes. The methodology uses many fancy words to describe simple processes, but after using it for some time it will all make sense.
