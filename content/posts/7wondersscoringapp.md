This project was completed in order to further my knowledge of AnguarJS and Javascript. It's a simple app for tracking score in the board game '7 Wonders', with the possibility of adding the 'Leaders' expansion as well. To add a bit of flavor, I included a chart displaying the players scores relative to one another. To implement this I used [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), which is easy to setup and use to make beautiful and responsive charts. 

The logic of changing player count, updating the UI and handling the input fields is made possible by using standard angular directives. The front-end is based on the bootstrap CSS framework.

## Technologies, Languages & Frameworks

During the project I made use of the following technologies, languages and frameworks:

- **javascript** -- used for powering the app logic and 
- **angular** -- makes the UI responsive to user inputs
- **bootstrap** - CSS franework used for the front-end
