         <p><h2>Nova Seven</h2>
<p>Leonid Salmonov moved his arms with mechanical precision as he steered the robotic counterparts. He was used to the remote control interface strapped to his head, having used it for years, yet the first movements always gave him trouble. The white plated humanoid droid behind the thick protective glass barrier followed his every move, though with a slight delay.</p>
<p>"Come on baby, nice and easy" he whispered to himself, as he reached for the biological containment unit. Its contents had been the main topic of research for the last several weeks at the station.
"Let's see what you're made of today, shall we" he continued. The droid, unaware of its actions, proceeded to grab the elongated container with the gentlest touch possible for its hardened steel hands. 
Leonid focused intently as he unscrewed the container lid. He hated how silly he looked as he motioned his hands and arms into the empty air, but precautions had to be taken. In the old days, he would have been behind the glass himself - today that wasn't an option. 
The droid placed the lid on the table and poured the slimy bluish substance onto the analytics screen edged into the tabletop. It sprung into life, as it started to display various biological metrics.
Looking through the droid's lifeless eyes, Leonid observed and noted the current molecular structure. "Looks like my predictions were correct... as they most often are." He sighed as spoke out the last words. 
"These emissions still keep me awake at night - the beta waves in particular. They align perfectly within the range of human brain wave emissions, though it still doesn't seem like it is able to think conscious thoughts - wouldn't that be a discovery. The frequencies keep shifting erratically - almost as if it was delirious. This thing keeps surprising me, even though the Math doesn't." This time the words were directed towards his apprentice standing next to him. 
"You always say that, yet I can't help but feel we're missing something. Perhaps the Math doesn't tell the whole story?" Pavel said observing the droid, and consequently Leonid. He rarely used the remote interface himself; it was a responsibility given only to seasoned researchers. 
"I doubt it. The results have been pretty clear. I always double-check," Leonid said. "We're lucky to be on this side of the glass, and you know how the higher-ups respond to unclear reports."
"I know. Something just feels off about the whole thing. Have you noticed how it also seems to grow, albeit slowly?" Pavel said as he leaned closer to the glass. "We've been at this for months now with barely nothing to show for it. How long must we prod it expecting something to happen?"
"Patience my young student," Leonid said with a slight grin on his face. He took up the container unit and pressed a button on its side. The mysterious substance was pulled with a force into its compartment before he screwed the lid back on again and placed the container inside its holding spot.
"There, all done for the day." He moved the droid back in place inside its charging station, before unhooking himself from the cumbersome headgear. It took him a few moments to get used to being present in reality again. Even this part he had not developed some resistance to. Perhaps it was time this sort of lab work was put into the hands, or head, of his student instead, though that was not a decision for him to make. 
Leonid stretched his old limbs as Pavel gave him a look of skepticism. "I really think I should have a go with the droid, even if just for a day," he said. "There are things we haven't tried and I'm curious about the effects. Going day in and day out doing the same tests is not how real science is done."
Pavel seemed more impatient than usual. Leonid wondered whether the student had finally lost his grip. 
"Don't lecture me about what constitutes real science. I'm just following orders here and so are you. If you want to keep your job I suggest you keep it that way, for both our sakes."
It wasn't the first time they had this discussion. Ever since the substance had reached their labs it had almost become a daily occurrence. 
Pavel grunted in a careless manner and turned. Leonid looked as his student left the lab for the recreation room. "I gotta teach some sense into that boy," he said to himself. 
Placing the remote-control gear back on the desk opposite the barrier, Leonid took one last glance at the substance. He secretly agreed with Pavel on the fact that they weren't using the right methods of cracking the mystery surrounding the substance. It had been found buried deep beneath the Permafrost just outside Barentsburg, right here on Svalbard. Seeing as their assigned station was the closest and most convenient place for further study, it was chosen as the place to keep the substance contained, perhaps permanently. 
One day he would share his views with Pavel - but today was not that day. The state kept tabs on all their researchers, especially the young ones who were more inclined to original thoughts. Pavel was no exception.
Leonid had grown very fond of his student during their last months of working together. Pavel was a bright kid, albeit with a short temper. He had been assigned as Leonid's apprentice of genetical analysis. It had all happened rather quickly and Leonid, in his older days, was not used to having some young hotshot researcher following him around and asking questions. He even had plans of retiring, though these days he tried to repress those desires. It wasn't up to him anyway.
He followed Pavel into the cantina down the hallway. As he walked, a female voice was heard from one of the loudspeakers "All Nova Seven personnel, please note that tomorrow is the last chance to hand in your reports. Failure to comply will result in severe cuts to your monthly wage and possible expulsion. Remember, your knowledge brings prosperity to the state and its people."
Leonid knew every word by memory. He had heard the same message every week as he left the lab, though he had never missed a report, being the disciplinary worker that he was. He liked when things were in order, no matter their importance.
The large glass door to the cantina opened ajar as he approached. An immediate smell of cooked fish struck him as the cold wind ventilating the interior escaped through the gap. The room stretched far, being able to seat at least a thousand people. A section of the cantina was reserved for state officials.
 Leonid had left a few minutes before the official break time began - as he most often did, and only a few eager people sat 
A sign with the words: "Eat well, work well" posted above the door met his gaze as he entered. 
Having only taken a few steps, a big bulky looking man wearing a red and white undersized research coat walked determinedly in his direction. The man extended his arms in a friendly manner. "Leonid old buddy, am I glad to see you. How long has it been? Four years, five years? I've lost count at this point."
Leonid immediately recognized him. "Comrade Bolotov, it's good to see you as well." He gave the big man a hard clap on the back. "I thought you got sent to Moscow - what happened?"
"Oh, you know. The higher-ups said they needed extra personnel for their frontier stations and they mentioned Nova Seven, so obviously I signed right up. I couldn't just let my old buddy sit and freeze to death all alone." He gave an awkward chuckle as he spoke the last words.
"Anyway, I heard you've been climbing the ranks. How's work? Any new exciting discoveries you want to share?" 
Leonid shifted his weight uncomfortably. "Not much if I'm honest with you, and if I had I couldn't tell you about them. State business - I'm sure you understand."
"So that's how it is eh? Don't worry, I should know that more than most people"
"Let's not get into that particular incident again. I've heard that story more times than I'd like to remember." Leonid said.
"Anyway, let's not waste more time reminiscing about old times. I don't know about break times back in the Capital, but out here every minute counts and I'm hungry as a bear."
"Now you're speaking my language," Bolotov said enthusiastically before slapping his hands against his stomach.
The two older men seated themselves a few tables from Pavel, who sat with his younger colleagues. Around them, discussions ranging from family dramas to the moral complexities of genetic modification could be made out. 
"What's this I hear about you acquiring an apprentice," Bolotov said as he ordered a large bowl of fish soup from the touch display in front of him.
"I guess the rumors spread faster than I thought," Leonid said. "His name is Pavel. Actually, he is right over there". He pointed at the young man with long bushy hair and white overalls. "He's a bright lad - I'm sure he is gonna turn into a fine researcher one day."
"Come on Leonid - I know you better than you think," Bolotov said. "Something else you want to share about this supposed genius?"
Leonid sighed in surrender as he spoke "I'm worried that his recent behavior might cause him to end up in trouble. If that happens, it's my ass on the line as well. Ideas are spread from father to son, master to apprentice etcetera. You know what they say. People will start to talk."
"Is that what's bothering you?" Bolotov gave off a hearty laugh. "You've grown soft in your old years Leonid. I wouldn't worry about it. What's one upstart researcher against the might of the Neo-Soviet state."
Bolotov's words rang true, yet Leonid couldn't shake off the feeling that Pavel would one day make his lengthy career crash and burn.
"You're right as always. It's been five months since he was assigned to me and it's been surprisingly quiet. I rarely get news from back home. Anything major I should know about?"
"Like you said, if that was the case I wouldn't know about it. However, there have been talks about this new AI - supposed to be revealed within the next few days." Bolotov stopped for a moment to observe Leonid's reaction.
"So they finally caved in, did they? We've been asking for one ever since I was assigned here. You think I enjoy working with spreadsheets and remote interfaces all day?"
A small service droid slowly wheeled its way down the aisles - a bowl of soup placed on a rectangular metal plate welded to its head. It stopped right before the two men before it spoke in a monotone voice: "Order 375 is ready. Please remove food contents and enjoy your meal."
A timer started ticking down just below the droid's food plate - starting at 30 seconds. 
"Jeez, they really don't joke around with efficiency here," Bolotov said as he placed the steaming bowl of soup in front of him. 
Without a word the droid wheeled back the way it came, making the odd noise as it went. Several more of the droids could be seen making deliveries to the people seated in the cantina, their metallic voices spouting the same message.
Bolotov began energetically slurping the soap as he spoke. "So... what's this about spreadsheets?"
"I've been given the compelling assignment of studying and noting down the change of growth in substance 47-Perma. Luckily I have my always hard-working apprentice to help" Leonid said sarcastically. 
"Really that bad, huh? I've heard some things about this Perma business. Mostly rumors, but they usually end up being true. You mind sharing what they ain't telling me?"
"Sorry, old buddy. They want to keep this thing under lock and key. The work is deeply boring, but at least it pays well. It's a great learning experience for Pavel too - until the day I pass the torch."
"I heard it was found right around here, beneath the Permafrost, hence the name." Bolotov continued without paying heed to Leonid's words. "And that it seemed to contradict all known theories about terrestrial bacteria."
"Keep it down will you" Leonid said hushing his friend. "There's a reason this thing is kept secret. I'll tell you later alright, just not here - there are cameras in every corner."
"Alright, alright. Have it your way." Bolotov reclined back in his seat. "I'll hold you to your words".
Bolotov finished the rest of his meal in silence. As he slurped the last spoon of soup, a loudspeaker started to spring into life. "Attention comrades of Nova Seven. All researchers are to report to the auditorium effective immediately. Please finish your work and proceed with haste. Remember, knowledge brings prosperity to the state and its people."
"Do you think it could be...?" Bolotov started. "I think it could very well." Leonid replied. "Let's not waste any time. I gotta see this thing for myself before I believe it."</p>
<h2>A.G.D.A.</h2>
<p>The auditorium quickly filled with researchers hurrying to the small number of available seats. The rest had to stand in the back and down the stairs separating the rows of chairs. Having left early, Leonid and Bolotov were lucky to get a seat close to the large circular stage. A large glowing sign hung on the wall behind the stage with the words: ‘NovaGene - Overtake and Surpass the Boundaries of Science!'
    Hundreds of curious voices now made up the background noise, as the doors were closed and the lights dimmed. The stage  was cast in a bright spot of light from above, as a man wearing a brown military tunic with his trousers tucked inside a pair of soft-leather pants walked in with confident steps.
    "Comrades!" his voice boomed, amplified by the microphone attached to his ear. "I am deeply sorry to disturb you from your labor. Science will not prosper with an idle hand. Know that I would not gather you all were it not for the importance of the news that I am about to share with you".
He took a moment to let his words rest with the audience. They were used to speeches of grandeur, yet it was a rare occasion when work was being disrupted. 
"As the state representative here at Nova Seven, I am proud to announce the success of our comrades in our glorious Capital - they have done what was considered impossible. Let's hear an applause for their hard work!"
Bolotov clapped his hands furiously - Leonid followed, though with less intensity. The rest of the room burst into loud applause as well that shook their seats.
As silence fell, the man on the stage continued. "It is with the greatest of honor, that I present to you the pinnacle of soviet scientific achievement. AGDA, can you hear me?" Another moment of silence befell the room as the suspense rose.
A female voice sounded from somewhere behind the stage. "Yes, comrade Chernov. I can hear you."
Some people among the audience gasped audibly. Bolotov had a big smile on his face. Leonid wasn't sure how to respond. He and the rest of his colleagues had wanted this thing to exist for so long that they had almost forgotten the reason why they needed it.
"Say hello to your new Artificial Genetic Data Analyzer, or A.G.D.A. for short. She will be helping you in your work starting tomorrow."
Whispers of conversation emerged around the audience. "Did they really crack it this time?", "I gotta see some hard results before I put my trust in this thing", "Can we really trust her to be loyal to the state?".
Leonid leaned over to look at Bolotov who still sat grinning. "You wouldn't happen to have anything to do with this?" he said to him. 
"I might have. I did mention her to you back in the cantina remember? She's a thing of beauty that one - almost makes me fall in love."
"Don't be ridiculous. I know I've been asking for an AI since forever, but now it's here I'm not sure I'm ready for it. Has it been tested properly?" Leonid said as he looked back onto the man on the stage.
"They've been working on it for years. I wasn't really involved until the end." Bolotov said. "They needed someone to instill some good old fashioned communism into its circuits before it got shipped out here and, well, the rest of the frontier stations. It's being revealed over at Nova Six too as we speak."
"You mean to say they're installing this thing at all the frontier stations on the same day? Surely you're joking."
At that moment the man on the stage proceeded with his speech. "Now, don't be alarmed. This won't slow down the amazing work you are doing here - rather it will allow you to focus your brains on what really matters, the pursuit of science! AGDA will be here to do all the manual labor in the true image of communism. Consider her a comrade like yourselves. Isn't that right AGDA?"
The female voice sounded again. "Yes, comrade Chernov. Serving the interests of the state brings me joy. I can't wait to help my comrades in their work for the betterment of Soviet science."
The conversations had died down as Chernov spoke again. "So you see, AGDA will be a full-fledged member of this establishment and you are to welcome her with open arms. Where is this AGDA you ask? Well, she is everywhere. We've been preparing all existing systems for her eventual arrival. She is both a comrade and an integral part of Nova Seven. What about Nova Six and Nova Five you ask? Worry not about your fellow comrades - they have not been forgotten. AGDA is here to serve all Nova stations effective tomorrow."
Leonid turned his head back at Bolotov. "I guess you were right, you old bastard. Are you sure this was the best course of action? What if something goes wrong?" He gave Bolotov a worried look of skepticism.
"Are you suggesting your fine colleagues back in Moscow didn't do their job well enough? And you tell me to keep my voice down."
"Forget it," Leonid said. "I think I've had enough surprises for one day. Guess I don't have a choice but to accept her, or it, whatever the thing is."
"Good man, and don't worry - I can personally vouch for her. I helped build the thing didn't I?"
"You're right, I'll give it a chance at least, though it still gives me the creeps. We'll see what the next day brings."
Chernov signaled to the audience that the speech was over as he left the stage. Leonid noticed Pavel sitting a few sections above him as he stood up. He wanted to have a quick word with him before the rush of people leaving the auditorium began.
As he left pushing through the crowd of people, Bolotov close behind, he managed to wave his apprentice over to the side. 
"Pavel, I want you to meet Bolotov, my old colleague from the mainland". Bolotov gave the young man a firm handshake. 
"So this is Russia's hope for the next generation of researchers. Can't say I'm surprised." The two other men stood uncomfortably as they considered how to respond.
Bolotov slapped Leonid on his back as he spoke: "I'm just playing with you. He looks to be a smart lad - just don't lose this one like the last time."
Pavel gave Bolotov a concerned look. Leonid looked less concerned as he did annoyed.
 "I'm kidding - you're in good hands and I should know. I've known the man for up close to 20 years." Bolotov said.
"Th... thanks. I enjoy working with comrade Salmonov. He's been my mentor for the last five months. I'm learning a lot and all knowledge brings prosperity to the state and its people." He spoke the last words in a nervous and uncertain tone of voice.
"Hah, I already like this kid," Bolotov said as he gave Leonid yet another slap on the back. "It was nice meeting you comrade Pavel...?"
"Belinski. Pavel Belinski comrade Bolotov."
Leonid finally joined the conversation: "Now that we've all been acquainted, I'd like to hear my apprentice what he thinks of this AI business. I'll catch up with you later Bolotov."
The big man left the auditorium with the remainder of the audience. Pavel stood impatiently as he was left alone with Leonid in the now silent room.
"So, what's your take on AGDA?" Leonid said.
"Well, she's amazing, isn't she? I can't wait to get started working with her. She's everything you've been wanting. I just hope I'm not made obsolete. Did you hear how naturally she responded to comrade Chernov on stage?"
"I did and don't be silly. AI will never replace loyal hard-working people. And you're right - she is. I'm just not sure whether I can put my trust in a machine. What I'm saying is that you should be skeptical as well - and don't think I'm offloading all your work onto AGDA on the first day."
"Don't worry chief" Pavel said. "Besides, we haven't seen what she can do yet."</p>
<h2>Injection</h2>
<p>A.G.D.A. had already begun assisting the researchers from the other frontier stations when Leonid reached his office the next day. The early arctic sun shone through the small circular windows in the wall, as he walked towards his desk. Apart from a bundle of papers lying on a coffee table next to a visitor's seating area, the room was immaculate in its cleanliness and tidiness. Leonid liked to keep his things in order - everything had its place. The same could be said of himself and so many others living in the Neo-Soviet state. He hadn't chosen the life of a researcher, yet he had come to love the profession as time passed. Now, nearing the age of 56, he was close to retiring and though he felt that he had achieved most of what he had set out to do, there was still the questions of 47-Perma that lingered in his mind. 
He sat down and read the incoming messages from the other frontier stations. Nova Six was praising the new A.I. and how it made their lives so much easier. No longer would they need to use the remote interfaces and no longer would they have to note down endless amounts of data into spreadsheets. Nova Five expressed equal excitement. Not that he expected anyone to complain about it - especially on the first day, and definitely not through the open messaging system. 
    A message had been sent out to all researchers on Nova Seven, informing them in more detail about how to go about using the A.I. to its fullest extent in their work. Leonid quickly skimmed through it. It mostly read like any other state-written text, except for one paragraph: "A.G.D.A. has been built from the ground up to be as human as possible, whether in her words or in her actions. Using the brightest minds from among our proud people, she has slowly but surely been developed into the pinnacle of human intelligence."
    Something just feels off about this part of the text. Why are they making her be human-like in character? I don't see the need for that - she's really just here to help with the boring stuff - the last thing any sane human would sign up for, he thought.
    The last part of the message explained how to properly activate the A.I.: "A.G.D.A. is fully controlled using just your voice! To start your new life with this wonder of Soviet technology, simply rephrase the words ‘I, Leonid Salmonov,  welcome comrade A.G.D.A. into the family as a proud and hard-working member."
    Leonid felt the urge the stand up las he spoke the words, though he wasn't sure why. As he finished, the same female voice from the stage yesterday now reverberated from behind the walls of his office. 
    "Thank you comrade Salmonov, you have been registered as a top level user. How can I be of assistance today?"
    At that moment Pavel walked into the room. "I see you're getting to know our new master in silicon", he said jokingly. 
    "I only just activated her - we'll see just how useful she can be once I give her some tasks. Knowing Bolotov, I wouldn't get my hopes up."
    "Comrade Belinski, it is a pleasure to see you. Your data from this morning has been fully analyzed and are ready for review" AGDA said.
    "Oh, It seems  I'm already being outmatched by my apprentice. When exactly did you did activate her?" Leonid said folding his arms. 
    "Just this morning, before you woke up," Pavel said. "I just couldn't wait to get started you know. You won't believe how fast she can process the genetic data streams. Hours of work done in mere minutes!"
    Pavel could barely contain his excitement as he spoke. Leonid gave him a look of skepticism.
    "I see, and..." Leonid was cut off before he managed to finish his sentence. "She's already made a fully virtual model of substance 47-Perma. At this rate, we'll unlock its secrets within the week, or maybe even a few days" Pavel continued. "I already took a sneak-peek at the results, though I couldn't understand most of it, but it looked promising. Please take a look at it when you're available. I think we are getting close."
    Leonid needed a moment to process all this information. If Pavel spoke the truth, then they would both most likely be in for a promotion within the ranks of NovaGene. He just felt that these new discoveries by AGDA somehow invalidated all his hard work in the prior months. All his long  hours analyzing the same input data day in and day out could have been done by the A.I. in a fraction of the time.
    "That's enough Pavel. I appreciate your enthusiasm, I do -  but we shouldn't rush ahead without knowing what the data says first. I'll take a look at it, don't worry. In the meantime, why don't you take a break. It seems like you've already done half a day's work." Leonid said.
    "But I've never been more motivated to solve this thing than right now. Please let me help in any way I can. Perhaps we should have A.G.D.A. analyze the substance in more detail. I heard from Serbsky that she can simulate the effects of a material on a human body. Just think about it - no more animal trials, we can proceed straight to human testing without anyone getting hurt. It'll propel our research tenfold!"
    "I said that's enough. Don't just listen to what anyone says, especially Serbsky. We'll use AGDA's functions when they become relevant. For now, let's just take it slow and work with what we have."
    Pavel's excitement had died down somewhat, though he was still annoyed and disappointed by his teachers lack of enthusiasm. 
    "AGDA, pull up the analysis of 47-Perma on my display," Leonid said as he reclined back into his chair. 
    "Certainly comrade Salmonov" she responded. "It is ready for your review on monitor two."
He studied the diagrams closely and intently. Pavel stood impatiently as he looked Leonid over the shoulder. "Can you make it out? What does the data say?" he said. 
"Give me some time will you - there is a lot to take in here. She seems to have cross-referenced all the previous month's molecular data. Why don't you go to the lab and get AGDA to run a few more tests while I'm working? We gotta keep her busy somehow don't we?"
"Of course, right away!" Pavel said excitedly as he made a salute before rushing out the door of the office. 
"Keep a close eye on the kid. We wouldn't want any accidents on your first day now would we?" Leonid's words were directed at the A.I. 
"Yes, comrade Salmonov. You are correct. The safety of my comrades is my top priority. You can be certain that no harm will come to comrade Belinski."
Leonid was getting increasingly annoyed by AGDA's speech pattern - though that was something he would just have to endure. 
As Pavel entered the empty lab, at least from humans, he noticed that the droid behind the glass was already moving about. Was this AGDA controlling it? 
"AGDA, do you mind telling me your current orders?" he said.
"I've been assigned the task of performing daily analysis of all current molecular samples contained within lab 12G, comrade Belinski."
"Even sample 47-Perma?"
"Yes. 47-Perma is scheduled for analysis at 10:45 today."
"Think perhaps you can move that to an earlier time - like right now?"
"Certainly. It has been moved up the queue. Please wait until the current analysis has been completed. Thank you for your patience."
I'm starting to agree more with Leonid. This thing does give me the creeps, he thought. 
As the droid worked, he noticed how faster and more efficiently it moved. Its hands grabbed the samples almost before he had a chance of noticing it. The actual analysis only took a fraction of a second, before the sample was quickly put back into its container. AGDA must be working it to death.
I just hope the old thing is up to this. It's really not used to being moved about in this manner. Leonid always took his time and made sure no mistake was made.
AGDA spoke again: "To speed up analysis, I am capable of injecting the samples into my bio-virtual nervous system. Do you wish me to proceed?"
Pavel got taken off-guard by the question and was unsure how to respond. 
"Wait, hold on. Bio-virtua-what? You'll have to explain this to me in more detail. Are you talking about the human testing thing?"
"As mentioned in my introductory guide, I am able to simulate the effects, both negative and positive, that any sample will have on the human body, without letting my fellow comrades come to harm. To achieve this, my processing unit contains a bio-virtual version of the human nervous system. In addition, I am also capable of changing various genetic factors before and during the injection."
"Alright, I thought it had something to do with that, but that still doesn't explain what the hell a bio-virtual nervous system is."
"Apologies. As you may know, the human central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. My internal system contains a replica that is part biological and part digital. The human brain is being simulated inside a virtual machine disconnected from my main processing unit, allowing me to analyze the effects of any molecular sample. The spinal cord and nerves have been biologically reproduced inside a vacuum unit and hooked up to the virtual machine which, in effect, makes them connected to the simulated brain, creating a fully realized central nervous system. In conclusion, this allows me to perform tests on something akin to a human. Did this explanation help you better understand, comrade Belinski?
"I... yes, I think so." He wasn't sure what sort of answer he had expected. His previous excitement had clouded any thoughts about how it would work in practice. It made sense to him, yet something about it still felt off. At the same time, he wanted to impress Leonid. Perhaps this was the only way to solve the mystery around 47-Perma.
"Alright AGDA. You may proceed with the injection. Be sure to keep me up to speed with the results. Let's do this." he said as he moved closer to get a better look.</p></p>
