         <p><p>The Microservices Architecture is an architectural style that attempts to structure an application into a set of independently deployable services, each running in its own process. The end goal of using microservices is to enable rapid deployment of complex applications that are or have become large in scope. Netflix is a good example of a company that has embraced this architectural style - however, it does not apply to just any application and should not be seen as a silver bullet. </p>
<p>By using microservices you commit yourself to design the system around its business capabilities instead of using a traditional 3-layered architecture (UI, Domain, Database) as seen in many monolithic applications. Each service exists for a very specific business-related purpose and may communicate with other services. Communication between microservices is often handled by using standard HTTP REST calls, mirroring the way many online services tend to communicate out in the 'real world'. Services should be decoupled and maintain their own domain logic. The endpoints (services) should be seen as 'smarter' than the infrastructure connecting them. A messaging system is the polar opposite of this, where the focus is instead being put having complex communication mechanisms.</p>
<p>By splitting each part of the domain into its own microservice, development can be sped up, as each team of developers can be assigned a single microservice to work on in isolation. In reality, this is not how most companies operate. Conway's law makes this point very clear:</p>
<p><em>"Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."</em> -- Melvyn Conway</p>
<p>In short, this means that any software produced by a company will mirror its internal design in the way they structure their employees. So, if your company has a team of UI designers, a team of database administrators and a team of middleware specialist, then the final design of the software will most likely end up being a monolithic 3-layered architecture. How then do we solve this issue? We structure each team around a single microservice, by taking in members from different departments to work together. Not all microservices require a database or a front-end, so each team can be formed to fit a very specific purpose. This also allows teams to work in parallel on many varying parts of the final system - something that would be impossible by following the traditional </p>

<p>In order to be successful in implementing a microservice architecture for your business, you must be ready to embrace DevOps and CI/CD practices. Since each service may be developed using its own languages, frameworks, and design principles, it becomes important to share knowledge between teams in order to better manage the increased complexity. Testing also becomes harder and will require a robust monitoring system to make sure that the services do not fail in production.</p></p>
